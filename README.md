# priority-scheduling-using-binomial-heap
Compare the efficiency of Min Heap and Binomial Heap implementations for priority scheduling. 
The project employs C++ to simulate job scheduling using both heap types, analyzing their processing times. 
Binomial Heap showcases superior efficiency. 
The Min Heap (`minheap-scheduler.cpp`) and Binomial Heap (`binomial-heap-scheduler.cpp`) codes are provided. 
Input is read from "jobs.txt". 
The project serves as a benchmark for understanding heap performance in scheduling algorithms.
